## Who we are?

We range from OutFox Community Team to players of Project OutFox, anyone who creates content is welcome, even you.

## Why join and how?

Having your project under this org will make it considered approved by OutFox Community Team and will be featured to be seen in our Blog Posts or any official future collection of community-made content, you can also get content added to the game by hosting it here and contacting Project OutFox developers.

You still have full control of the repository of your project, you control the license, the permissions, and if you want it private or removed while having full permission to brand your project as being a Tiny-Foxes project or verified as such.

If you do not want your project's main repository to be under this org, you are allowed to create a fork under Tiny-Foxes org.
